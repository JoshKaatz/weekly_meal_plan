Project Title: Weekly Meal Plan Generator
Description: My wife and I have trouble coming up with our weekly meal plan for work nights. We try to have a varied diet with some fairly consistent themes. This is the start to a (maybe) longer term project to input the recipes to create shopping lists from the recipes.
Features: 3 arrays with recipes we commonly make, randomly selects meals based off of our requirements (2 chicken meals, 1 other animal protein, and 1 veggie meal), ensures that recipes aren't repeated, shuffle recipes so that you don't eat the meals in the same order, output meals to eat in console.
How to use: Javascript file. Currently run it locally with node.js.
Future plans: Maybe make it run on a website to improve output formatting. Add ingredient lists to the recipes to be able to create shopping lists.
Technologies: Javascript
